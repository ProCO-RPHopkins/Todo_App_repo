Files: todo.py; index.html; & styles.css

Run: To run the Todo App, type "python todo.py" in the terminal. The following URL will appear in the terminal:
        http://127.0.0.1:5000/ To open the app on the server, press Ctrl (PC) and click the link.

Heading: My ToDo But Not Going to Get Done list

Notes: AI was not used to create this file. All information is based on my perceived understanding of how the app functions.

Basic Functions: 
1. The app has a container field that prompts the user to "Enter new task".
2. After the item is input, the user can either press the "Enter" button on their keyboard or click the "Add Task" button.
3. The item is then sent to a database and posted to the server in its own container.
4. The user can add as many tasks as they wish using the "Add Task" function.
5. Inside the container there is a "Delete" button that removes the item from the server list and from the database when clicked on.

Added Functions:
* "Sort Todos"
1. Once a list of tasks is made, the user can click on the "Sort Todos" button to alphabetize the tasks in ascending order.
2. The html file uses the GET method to fetch the sort function from todo.py. 
3. The content in the database is then sent to the server in sorted order.

* "Delete All"
1. The user can click on the "Delete All" button to clear all the tasks.
    -A popup window that asks the user if they are sure they want to delete everything would be practical as another feature.
2. When this button is clicked, the GET method calls the delete function from todo.py.
3. The content in the database is then completely cleared.

Added Styling:
1. The background color was changed.
2. A hover button was added that changes the color. 
3. Space was added between buttons for aesthetic purposes.
4. All buttons share the same styling from the custom-button class.
